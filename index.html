        <h2>My Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Charity Hollis. I am 23 years old and graduated from Georgia Southern University with a Biology degree. These are all of the things that I do in order to stay sane. I have a busy schedule, but I'll always make time for me. </p>

    <section id="animal babies">
        <h3>Animal Babies</h3>
        <p>I am currently working at a vet clinic as a vet technician whenever I am not training. I have the beautiful opportunity to love on so many cats and dogs everyday.</p>

    <section id="skating">
        <h3>Favorite Hobby</h3>
        <p>My favorite thing in the world to do is roller skate. It is quite literally food to my soul. I try to go to the rink at least once a week, usually on Thursdays.</p>

    <section id="gym">
        <h3>For the Mind</h3>
        <p>Going to the gym is something that I enjoy doing for both mind and body. Typically, I try to go to the gym at least three times a week.</p>
     </section>   
    <section id="explorations">
        <h3>Weekend Explorations</h3>
        <p>Every weekend I make it a point to get out of the house and explore somewhere new. The destination can be as small as a new resturant or as big as a different state. I'm pretty good at keeping up with it but sometimes I find more comfort in familiarity. </p>
     </section>   
    <section id="foods">
        <h3>Favorite Foods</h3>
        <p>I am a pretty simple girl, I can eat the same thing everyday with no problem.</p>
